This is KeystrokeDynamics.JS, a tool for analyzing keystroke dynamics in Web applications.

To see the application in action, check out [our website](http://www.tylerayoung.com/keystroke/).

[Keystroke dynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_dynamics) is a means of authenticating users based on information about the way they type. It can be used as a (behavioral) biometric in a multi-factor authentication system, so that even if a person's password becomes compromised, their account will not.
